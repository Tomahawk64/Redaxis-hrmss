# 🗑️ Event Delete Feature Added

## ✅ New Feature: Delete Events

### **What's New:**
You can now **delete events** that you created! Only the event organizer (creator) can delete their own events.

---

## 🎯 How It Works:

### **Delete Button Visibility:**
- ✅ **If you created the event** → Delete button (🗑️) appears next to "Join Event"
- ❌ **If someone else created it** → No delete button (you can only join)

### **Delete Process:**
1. Click the **trash icon (🗑️)** button on your event
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete this event?"
3. Click **OK** to confirm or **Cancel** to keep the event
4. If confirmed:
   - ✅ Event is deleted from database
   - ✅ Success message: "Event deleted successfully!"
   - ✅ Event list automatically refreshes
   - ✅ Event disappears from the list

---

## 🔐 Security Features:

### **Role-Based Access Control:**
- Only the **event organizer** can delete their events
- Other users cannot delete events they didn't create
- Backend validates ownership before deletion

### **Confirmation Dialog:**
- Prevents accidental deletions
- Shows event title in confirmation message
- Clear warning: "This action cannot be undone"

---

## 📝 Code Changes:

### **File Modified:** `src/components/Event1.jsx`

### **1. Added Imports:**
```javascript
import { FaTrash } from "react-icons/fa"; // Trash icon
import { getUser } from '../services/api';  // Get current user
```

### **2. Added Current User State:**
```javascript
const currentUser = getUser();
```

### **3. Added Delete Handler:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteEvent = async (eventId, eventTitle) => {
  // Confirm before deleting
  const confirmDelete = window.confirm(
    `Are you sure you want to delete the event "${eventTitle}"? This action cannot be undone.`
  );
  
  if (!confirmDelete) {
    return;
  }

  try {
    await eventsAPI.delete(eventId);
    alert('Event deleted successfully!');
    fetchEvents(); // Refresh the event list
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error.message || 'Failed to delete event');
  }
};
```

### **4. Added Organizer Check:**
```javascript
const isEventOrganizer = (event) => {
  return currentUser && 
         (event.organizer?._id === currentUser._id || 
          event.organizer === currentUser._id);
};
```

### **5. Updated Event Card UI:**
```jsx
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center gap-2">
  {/* Join Event Button */}
  <button 
    className="btn btn-primary px-4"
    onClick={() => handleJoinEvent(event)}
  >
    Join Event
  </button>
  
  {/* Delete Button - Only for organizer */}
  {isEventOrganizer(event) && (
    <button 
      className="btn btn-danger"
      onClick={() => handleDeleteEvent(event._id, event.title)}
      title="Delete Event"
    >
      <FaTrash />
    </button>
  )}
</div>
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions:

### **Test Case 1: Delete Your Own Event**

1. **Login** as any user (e.g., `john@redaxis.com`)
2. **Create a new event:**
   - Go to Event page
   - Select date and time
   - Click "Schedule New Event"
   - Fill form and submit
3. **Find your event** in the event list
4. ✅ **You should see:**
   - "Join Event" button (blue)
   - **🗑️ Delete button** (red) next to it
5. **Click the delete button** (🗑️)
6. ✅ **Confirmation dialog appears:**
   - Shows event title
   - "This action cannot be undone"
7. **Click OK**
8. ✅ **Expected Results:**
   - Alert: "Event deleted successfully!"
   - Event disappears from the list
   - List automatically refreshes

### **Test Case 2: Cannot Delete Others' Events**

1. **Login** as John
2. **Look at events created by Maria** (or another user)
3. ✅ **You should see:**
   - "Join Event" button (blue)
   - ❌ **NO delete button** (because you didn't create it)
4. **You can only join** these events, not delete them

### **Test Case 3: Cancel Deletion**

1. **Click delete button** on your event
2. **Confirmation dialog appears**
3. **Click Cancel**

## 🎨 UI/UX Design:

### **Button Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Join Event]    [🗑️]               │
│   (Blue)       (Red)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Button Styles:**
- **Join Event:** Blue (btn-primary), larger with padding
- **Delete:** Red (btn-danger), compact with icon only
- **Spacing:** Small gap between buttons (gap-2)
- **Alignment:** Center aligned

### **Hover States:**
- Delete button shows tooltip: "Delete Event"
- Both buttons have hover effects
- Visual feedback on interaction

---

## 🔍 Edge Cases Handled:

### **1. User Not Logged In:**
```javascript
return currentUser && ...
```
- If no user is logged in, isEventOrganizer returns false
- Delete button never shows

### **2. Organizer ID Comparison:**
```javascript
event.organizer?._id === currentUser._id || 
event.organizer === currentUser._id
```
- Handles both populated and non-populated organizer fields
- Works whether organizer is object or just ID

### **3. Confirmation Required:**
```javascript
const confirmDelete = window.confirm(...);
if (!confirmDelete) return;
```
- User must explicitly confirm deletion
- Accidental clicks won't delete events

### **4. Error Handling:**
```javascript
try {
  await eventsAPI.delete(eventId);
  alert('Event deleted successfully!');
} catch (error) {
  alert(error.message || 'Failed to delete event');
}
```
- Shows success message on successful deletion
- Shows error message if deletion fails
- Graceful error handling

### **5. List Refresh:**
```javascript
fetchEvents(); // Refresh after deletion
```
- Event list automatically updates
- No need to manually refresh page
- Immediate UI feedback

## 🛡️ Security Considerations:

### **Frontend Validation:**
1. Check if user is logged in
2. Compare user ID with organizer ID
3. Show delete button only to organizer

### **Backend Validation:**
The backend should also verify:
1. User is authenticated
2. User is the event organizer
3. Event exists before deletion

### **Example Backend Check:**
```javascript
// In eventController.js
export const deleteEvent = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const event = await Event.findById(req.params.id);
    
    if (!event) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Event not found' });
    }
    
    // Verify organizer
    if (event.organizer.toString() !== req.user.id) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Not authorized to delete this event' });
    }
    
    await event.deleteOne();
    res.status(200).json({ success: true, message: 'Event deleted' });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};
```

## 🎯 API Endpoint Used:

### **DELETE /api/events/:id**
```javascript
// From api.js
delete: (id) => apiRequest(`/events/${id}`, { method: 'DELETE' })
```

**Request:**
- Method: DELETE
- URL: `/api/events/EVENT_ID`
- Headers: Authorization Bearer token

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Event deleted"
}
```

---

## ✨ Benefits:

1. **Event Management** - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. **User Control** - Users can manage their own events
3. **Data Cleanup** - Remove cancelled or outdated events
4. **Better UX** - Clear visual indication of deletable events
5. **Safe Deletion** - Confirmation prevents accidents
6. **Instant Feedback** - Immediate UI updates after deletion
