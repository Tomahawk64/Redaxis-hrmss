# Component Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Leaves.jsx - Duplicate API Definition
**Problem:** The `Leaves.jsx` file was defining its own `leaveAPI` object locally instead of importing it from the centralized `api.js` file. This caused:
- Code duplication
- Potential inconsistencies between API methods
- Method signature mismatches (PATCH vs PUT)

**Solution:** 
- Removed the local `leaveAPI` definition (lines 6-66)
- Updated imports to include `leaveAPI` from `'../services/api'`

### 2. API.js - Missing delete method and wrong updateStatus signature
**Problem:** 
- The `leaveAPI.updateStatus` method signature didn't match how it was being called
- Missing `delete` method in the leaveAPI

**Solution:**
- Updated `updateStatus` to accept `(id, status, remarks)` parameters
- Added `delete` method to handle leave cancellation

## Files Modified:
1. `src/components/Leaves.jsx` - Lines 1-66 (removed duplicate API, fixed imports)
2. `src/services/api.js` - Lines 218-235 (updated leaveAPI methods)

## Testing Instructions:

1. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Attendance page (`/attendance`)
   - Should load without errors
   - Check browser console for any errors

3. Navigate to the Leaves page (`/leaves`)
   - Should load without errors
   - Check browser console for any errors

4. Test functionality:
   - Apply for leave
   - Check if admin can approve/reject leaves
   - Cancel a leave request

## Common Error Messages (now fixed):
- ❌ `leaveAPI.delete is not a function`
- ❌ `Cannot read property 'updateStatus' of undefined`
- ❌ API method mismatch errors
- ✅ All should now work correctly!
