# Attendance Time-Based Logic Implementation ✅

## Overview
Implemented automatic status calculation based on working hours, with fixed Sunday week-off and variable Saturday schedules per employee.

---

## 📋 Business Rules Implemented

### 1. Working Hours Status Calculation
When an employee checks out, the system automatically determines their attendance status:

| Working Hours | Status | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **< 5 hours** | ❌ **Absent** | Insufficient working time |
| **5 - 7.5 hours** | 🟡 **Half-Day** | Partial attendance |
| **> 7.5 hours** | ✅ **Present** | Full day present |

### 2. Week-Off Policy
- **Sunday**: Fixed week-off for ALL employees (cannot check-in)
- **Saturday**: Variable - depends on individual employee setting
  - If `saturdayWorking = false`: Saturday is week-off
  - If `saturdayWorking = true`: Saturday is a working day

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### 1. User Model (`backend/models/User.js`)
**Added new field:**
```javascript
saturdayWorking: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false, // false = Saturday off, true = Saturday working
}
```

### 2. Attendance Controller (`backend/controllers/attendanceController.js`)

#### ✅ **checkIn() Function**
- Added Sunday check (dayOfWeek === 0): Prevents check-in with error message
- Added Saturday check (dayOfWeek === 6): Checks user's `saturdayWorking` setting
- Returns appropriate error if trying to check in on week-off

```javascript
// Prevents check-in on Sunday
if (dayOfWeek === 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    message: 'Today is Sunday - Week Off. You cannot check in.' 
  });
}

// Prevents check-in on Saturday if not configured as working day
if (dayOfWeek === 6 && !user.saturdayWorking) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    message: 'Today is Saturday - Week Off for you. You cannot check in.' 
  });
}
```

#### ✅ **checkOut() Function**
- Calculates working hours: `(checkOut - checkIn) / (1000 * 60 * 60)`
- Auto-determines status based on hours:
  - `< 5 hours` → `status = 'absent'`
  - `5 - 7.5 hours` → `status = 'half-day'`
  - `> 7.5 hours` → `status = 'present'`
- Returns success message with calculated status and hours

```javascript
// Auto-calculate status based on working hours
if (attendance.workingHours < 5) {
  attendance.status = 'absent';
} else if (attendance.workingHours >= 5 && attendance.workingHours < 7.5) {
  attendance.status = 'half-day';
} else {
  attendance.status = 'present';
}
```

#### ✅ **getAttendanceStats() Function**
- Added accurate working days calculation
- Excludes Sundays from all calculations
- Excludes Saturdays based on employee's `saturdayWorking` setting
- Returns `saturdayWorking` flag in response for frontend display

**Helper Functions Added:**
```javascript
// Check if a date is a working day
const isWorkingDay = (date, saturdayWorking = false) => {
  const dayOfWeek = date.getDay();
  if (dayOfWeek === 0) return false; // Sunday always off
  if (dayOfWeek === 6) return saturdayWorking; // Saturday variable
  return true; // Monday-Friday working
};

// Count working days in a date range
const countWorkingDays = (startDate, endDate, saturdayWorking = false) => {
  // Iterates through date range, counts only working days
};
```

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### 1. Employees Form (`src/components/Employees.jsx`)

**Added to formData state:**
```javascript
saturdayWorking: false,
```

**Added form field:**
- Checkbox switch for "Saturday is a working day"
- Positioned after Reporting Manager field
- Informative help text: "Enable if this employee works on Saturdays. Sundays are week off for all."

**Form Section:**
```jsx
<div className="form-check form-switch mt-2">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    checked={formData.saturdayWorking}
    onChange={(e) => setFormData({...formData, saturdayWorking: e.target.checked})}
  />
  <label>Saturday is a working day</label>
</div>
```

## 📊 Attendance Stats Calculation

### Before (Incorrect):
- Counted calendar days as working days
- Included Sundays and Saturdays
- Attendance percentage was inaccurate

### After (Correct): ✅
- Counts only actual working days
- Excludes Sundays (all employees)
- Excludes Saturdays (based on employee setting)
- Accurate attendance percentage calculation

**Formula:**
```
Attendance % = (Present Days + Half-Day * 0.5) / Working Days * 100
```

Where Working Days = Only Monday-Friday + Saturdays (if saturdayWorking = true)

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Employee with Saturday OFF
**User**: Sarah (saturdayWorking = false)

| Day | Action | Result |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Monday | Check-in 9:00 AM, Check-out 6:30 PM (9.5 hours) | ✅ Present |
| Tuesday | Check-in 9:00 AM, Check-out 3:00 PM (6 hours) | 🟡 Half-Day |
| Wednesday | Check-in 9:00 AM, Check-out 12:00 PM (3 hours) | ❌ Absent |
| Saturday | Tries to check-in | ⛔ Error: "Saturday is week off for you" |
| Sunday | Tries to check-in | ⛔ Error: "Sunday is week off" |

### Example 2: Employee with Saturday ON
**User**: John (saturdayWorking = true)

| Day | Action | Result |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Monday | Check-in 9:00 AM, Check-out 6:00 PM (9 hours) | ✅ Present |
| Saturday | Check-in 9:00 AM, Check-out 6:00 PM (9 hours) | ✅ Present |
| Sunday | Tries to check-in | ⛔ Error: "Sunday is week off" |

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Time-based Status Calculation
1. Check-in at 9:00 AM
2. Check-out at different times:
   - **12:00 PM (3 hours)** → Should mark "Absent"
   - **2:00 PM (5 hours)** → Should mark "Half-Day"
   - **4:30 PM (7.5 hours)** → Should mark "Half-Day"
   - **6:00 PM (9 hours)** → Should mark "Present"

### Test 2: Sunday Week-Off (All Users)
1. Try checking in on Sunday
2. Should receive error: "Today is Sunday - Week Off. You cannot check in."

### Test 3: Saturday Variable Schedule
**For user with saturdayWorking = false:**
1. Try checking in on Saturday
2. Should receive error: "Today is Saturday - Week Off for you. You cannot check in."

**For user with saturdayWorking = true:**
1. Check-in on Saturday
2. Should allow check-in and work normally

### Test 4: Attendance Stats Accuracy
1. Set employee with saturdayWorking = false
2. Check stats for a month
3. Verify working days excludes Sundays and Saturdays
4. Verify attendance percentage is accurate

3. **Automated Calculation**: No manual intervention needed
4. **Transparent Rules**: Clear thresholds for all status types
5. **Accurate Analytics**: Working days calculation excludes non-working days

## 🔒 Validation Rules

| Rule | Implementation | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Sunday always off | Check in controller | ✅ |
| Saturday variable per user | Check in controller + DB field | ✅ |
| < 5 hours = Absent | Check out controller | ✅ |
| 5-7.5 hours = Half-Day | Check out controller | ✅ |
| > 7.5 hours = Present | Check out controller | ✅ |
| Working days accurate | Stats controller | ✅ |

---

## 📝 Database Migration Note

**Important**: Existing employees will have `saturdayWorking = false` by default (Saturday off).

To update specific employees to work on Saturdays:
```javascript
// Using MongoDB or seed script
await User.updateMany(
  { employeeId: { $in: ['EMP001', 'EMP002'] } },
  { $set: { saturdayWorking: true } }
);
```

Or update via Employees form in the UI (edit employee, check Saturday checkbox).
