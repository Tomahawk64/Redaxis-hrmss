# ✅ CALENDAR SYNC & HALF-DAY LEAVE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Calendar Not Showing Colors
**Problem**: Attendance calendar wasn't showing colors for present days (Oct 21, 23 were present but calendar was blank)
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed `tileClassName` function to properly handle employee ID matching with support for both `_id` and `id` properties, and correctly filter for selected employee when admin/HR is viewing.

### Issue 2: Half-Day Leave Type Missing
**Problem**: No "Half Day" option in leave application form
**Solution**: ✅ Added "Half Day Leave" as a new leave type with proper backend and frontend support.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Calendar Color Sync (`src/components/Attendance.jsx`)

#### Before:
```javascript
const tileClassName = ({ date }) => {
  const records = getAttendanceForDate(date);
  if (records.length > 0) {
    const myRecord = records.find(r => r.employee._id === currentUser._id || r.employee === currentUser._id);
    // Issue: Didn't handle selectedEmployee filter or flexible ID matching
```

#### After:
```javascript
const tileClassName = ({ date }) => {
  const records = getAttendanceForDate(date);
  if (records.length > 0) {
    const userId = currentUser._id || currentUser.id;
    
    let myRecord;
    if (canManage && selectedEmployee) {
      // Admin/HR viewing specific employee
      myRecord = records.find(r => {
        const empId = typeof r.employee === 'object' ? (r.employee._id || r.employee.id) : r.employee;
        return empId === selectedEmployee;
      });
    } else {
      // Employee viewing own data
      myRecord = records.find(r => {
        const empId = typeof r.employee === 'object' ? (r.employee._id || r.employee.id) : r.employee;
        return empId === userId;
      });
    }
```

**Result**: Calendar now shows:
- 🟢 **Green** for Present days (Oct 21, 23)
- 🔵 **Teal/Cyan** for On Leave days (Oct 28, 29)
- 🟡 **Yellow** for Half Day (when implemented)
- 🔴 **Red** for Absent days

### 2. Half-Day Leave Type

#### Backend Changes

**A. Leave Model (`backend/models/Leave.js`)**
```javascript
leaveType: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['sick', 'casual', 'earned', 'maternity', 'paternity', 'unpaid', 'half-day'], // Added 'half-day'
  required: true,
}
```

**B. Leave Sync Function (`backend/controllers/leaveController.js`)**
```javascript
// Now checks if leave type is 'half-day' and sets appropriate status
status: leave.leaveType === 'half-day' ? 'half-day' : 'on-leave',
workingHours: leave.leaveType === 'half-day' ? 4 : 0
```

**C. Leave Removal Function**
```javascript
// Now removes both 'on-leave' and 'half-day' status records
status: { $in: ['on-leave', 'half-day'] }
```

#### Frontend Changes

**Leaves Component (`src/components/Leaves.jsx`)**
```javascript
const leaveTypes = [
  { value: 'casual', label: 'Casual Leave', icon: '🏖️', color: 'primary' },
  { value: 'sick', label: 'Sick Leave', icon: '🤒', color: 'danger' },
  { value: 'half-day', label: 'Half Day Leave', icon: '⏰', color: 'warning' }, // NEW!
  { value: 'privilege', label: 'Privilege Leave', icon: '✈️', color: 'success' },
  { value: 'unpaid', label: 'Unpaid Leave', icon: '📅', color: 'secondary' }
];
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Calendar Sync Logic

1. **Employee views own attendance**:
   - Calendar shows colors for their own records only
   - Green for present, teal for leaves, yellow for half-days

2. **Admin/HR views all employees**:
   - Without filter: Shows admin's own calendar colors
   - With employee selected: Shows selected employee's colors

3. **Real-time updates**:
   - After check-in: Calendar updates to green
   - After leave approval: Calendar updates to teal/yellow
   - After sync: All approved leaves appear on calendar

### Half-Day Leave Workflow

1. **Employee applies** for half-day leave
2. **HR/Admin approves** the leave
3. **System automatically**:
   - Creates attendance record with status `half-day`
   - Sets working hours to 4 hours
   - Adds note: "Half-day Leave"
   - Calendar shows yellow color
4. **If rejected**:
   - System removes the half-day attendance record
   - Calendar returns to normal

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Calendar still not showing colors"
**Problem**: Calendar is blank even though records exist
**Solution**:
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + Shift + R
2. Check you're looking at the correct month (October 2025)
3. If admin, make sure employee is selected from dropdown
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### "Half-Day not showing in dropdown"
**Problem**: Can't see "Half Day Leave" option
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl + Shift + R
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check backend is running (should restart automatically with nodemon)

### "Half-day leave shows wrong color"
**Problem**: Half-day shows green/teal instead of yellow
**Solution**:
1. Verify leave type is exactly "half-day" (not "half day" with space)
2. Re-sync leaves: Click "Sync Approved Leaves" button
3. Check backend logs for proper status setting

### "Calendar shows my colors even when viewing another employee"
**Problem**: Admin sees own colors instead of selected employee's
**Solution**: This is fixed now! Hard refresh and it should work correctly.
