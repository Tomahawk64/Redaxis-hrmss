# Reporting Manager (RM) System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the multi-level Reporting Manager hierarchy system in the HRMS application.

## ✅ BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION (100% Complete)

### 1. Database Models

#### **User Model Updates** (`backend/models/User.js`)
Added the following fields to support RM hierarchy:

```javascript
reportingManager: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User',
  default: null
}

managementLevel: {
  type: Number,
  enum: [0, 1, 2, 3],
  default: 0
  // 0 = Employee, 1 = L1/RM, 2 = L2/Senior Manager, 3 = L3/Admin
}

teamMembers: [{
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User'
}]

canApproveLeaves: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
}

canManageAttendance: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
}
```

**Automatic Hooks:**
- Post-save hook: Automatically adds employee to manager's `teamMembers` array
- Pre-update hook: Removes employee from old manager's team when reassigned

#### **Leave Model Updates** (`backend/models/Leave.js`)
Added escalation tracking and approval workflow fields:

```javascript
approvalLevel: {
  type: Number,
  default: 1 // Current approval level
}

currentApprover: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User' // Person who needs to approve
}

approvalDeadline: {
  type: Date // Auto-set to 48 hours from submission
}

escalatedTo: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User'
}

escalationDate: Date

isEscalated: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
}

approvalHistory: [{
  approver: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  action: String, // 'approved', 'rejected', 'escalated'
  date: Date,
  remarks: String,
  level: Number
}]
```

**Automatic Hook:**
- Pre-save hook: Sets `approvalDeadline` (48 hours) and `currentApprover` (employee's reporting manager)

### 2. API Endpoints

#### **Team Management Routes** (`/api/team/*`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Authorization |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/team/members` | Get all team members reporting to current manager | Protected |
| GET | `/api/team/stats` | Get team statistics (present, absent, on-leave, pending leaves, attendance rate) | Protected |
| GET | `/api/team/attendance` | Get team attendance records (with date range filter) | Protected |
| GET | `/api/team/leaves` | Get team leave requests (with status filter) | Protected |
| POST | `/api/team/leaves/bulk-approve` | Bulk approve/reject multiple leave requests | Protected |
| GET | `/api/team/performance` | Get detailed team performance report | Protected |
| GET | `/api/team/managers` | Get all managers (L1+) for dropdown selection | Protected |
| GET | `/api/team/calendar` | Get team calendar view (month view with daily status) | Protected |

#### **Updated Leave Routes** (`/api/leaves/*`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Authorization |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| PATCH/PUT | `/api/leaves/:id/status` | Update leave status (approve/reject) | RMs + Admin + HR |
| POST | `/api/leaves/check-escalations` | Manually trigger escalation check | Admin + HR only |

**Key Change:** Removed `authorize('admin', 'hr')` restriction from status update routes to allow RMs to approve leaves.

### 3. Controllers

#### **Team Controller** (`backend/controllers/teamController.js` - 550+ lines)

**8 Major Functions:**

1. **`getTeamMembers()`**
   - Returns all employees where `reportingManager === req.user.id`
   - Populates department information
   - Sorted alphabetically by first name

2. **`getTeamStats()`**
   - Returns:
     - `teamSize`: Total team members count
     - `todayStats`: Present/absent/on-leave counts for today
     - `pendingLeaves`: Count of pending leave requests
     - `monthlyAttendanceRate`: Average attendance % for current month

3. **`getTeamAttendance()`**
   - Query params: `startDate`, `endDate`, `month`
   - Returns attendance records for team members
   - Populates employee details
   - Sorted by date (newest first)

4. **`getTeamLeaves()`**
   - Query params: `status` (pending/approved/rejected)
   - Returns leave requests for team members
   - Populates employee, approver, escalation details
   - Sorted by submission date (newest first)

5. **`bulkApproveLeaves()`**
   - Request body: `{ leaveIds: [], status: 'approved'|'rejected', remarks: '' }`
   - Validates team membership for each leave
   - Updates all selected leaves
   - Returns success/failure counts

6. **`getTeamPerformance()`**
   - Query params: `month` (optional)
   - Returns per-employee metrics:
     - Attendance rate
     - Total working hours
     - Leaves taken (by type)
   - Sorted by attendance rate (descending)

7. **`getManagers()`**
   - Returns all users with `managementLevel >= 1`
   - Includes: name, email, role, position, managementLevel
   - For dropdown selection in employee forms

8. **`getTeamCalendar()`**
   - Query params: `month`, `year`
   - Returns month calendar with daily grid
   - Each day shows employee status (present/absent/on-leave)

#### **Leave Controller Updates** (`backend/controllers/leaveController.js`)

**`updateLeaveStatus()` - Completely Rewritten (100+ lines)**

Multi-level approval logic:
- ✅ Admin can approve any leave
- ✅ HR can approve any leave except other HR leaves
- ✅ RM can approve only team members' leaves
- ✅ Prevents self-approval
- ✅ Tracks approval in `approvalHistory` array
- ✅ Resets escalation flags on approval/rejection
- ✅ Validates team membership for RMs

### 4. Escalation Service

#### **`backend/utils/escalationService.js`** (200+ lines)

**Three Main Functions:**

1. **`checkAndEscalateLeaves()`**
   - Finds pending leaves where `approvalDeadline < now` and `isEscalated = false`
   - Determines escalation target:
     - If currentApprover has a reportingManager → escalate to them
     - Else → escalate to first admin
   - Updates leave:
     - Sets `isEscalated = true`
     - Sets `escalatedTo` and `escalationDate`
     - Updates `currentApprover` to next level
     - Increments `approvalLevel`
     - Extends `approvalDeadline` by 24 hours
     - Adds escalation to `approvalHistory`
   - Returns: `{ checked, escalated, failed, escalatedLeaves, errors }`

2. **`triggerEscalationCheck()`**
   - Express route handler
   - Allows admin/HR to manually trigger escalation check
   - Returns escalation results

3. **`setupEscalationCron()`**
   - Sets up automated cron job
   - Runs every 6 hours (SIX_HOURS = 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
   - Initial run: 5 seconds after function call
   - Console logs: "✅ Escalation cron job scheduled (every 6 hours)"

**Cron Schedule:**
- Initial delay: 5 seconds (after DB connection)
- Recurring: Every 6 hours
- Automatic escalation after 48-hour deadline

### 5. Server Integration

#### **`backend/server.js`**

```javascript
// Import team routes
import teamRoutes from './routes/teamRoutes.js';
import { setupEscalationCron } from './utils/escalationService.js';

// Register team routes
app.use('/api/team', teamRoutes);

// Start escalation cron after DB connection
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('✅ MongoDB connected successfully');
    setupEscalationCron(); // Start 6-hour escalation checks
  });
```

## ✅ FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION (Completed)

### 1. API Service Updates

#### **`src/services/api.js`**

```javascript
export const teamAPI = {
  getTeamMembers: () => apiRequest('/team/members'),
  getTeamStats: () => apiRequest('/team/stats'),
  getTeamAttendance: (params = {}) => apiRequest(`/team/attendance?${params}`),
  getTeamLeaves: (params = {}) => apiRequest(`/team/leaves?${params}`),

### 3. Component Updates

#### **Sidebar** (`src/components/SideBar.jsx`)

**Added "My Team" Menu Item:**

```javascript
import { FaUserFriends } from "react-icons/fa";

const navItems = [
  // ... other items
  { 
    name: "My Team", 
    icon: <FaUserFriends />, 
    path: "/my-team", 
    showForManagers: true // Only show if managementLevel >= 1
  },
  // ... other items
];

// Conditional rendering logic
if (item.showForManagers && (!user?.managementLevel || user.managementLevel < 1)) {
  return null;
}
```

**Visibility:**
- ✅ Shows for users with `managementLevel >= 1`
- ❌ Hidden for regular employees (`managementLevel = 0`)
- ✅ Icon: `FaUserFriends`
- ✅ Route: `/my-team`

#### **App Routes** (`src/App.jsx`)

**Added MyTeam Route:**

```javascript
import MyTeam from "./components/MyTeam";

// Inside protected routes
<Route path="/my-team" element={<MyTeam />} />
```

#### **Employees Component** (`src/components/Employees.jsx`)

**Added RM Fields to Employee Form:**

1. **Management Level Dropdown**:
   ```javascript
   <select value={formData.managementLevel}>
     <option value="0">Level 0 - Employee</option>
     <option value="1">Level 1 - Reporting Manager (L1)</option>
     <option value="2">Level 2 - Senior Manager (L2)</option>
     <option value="3">Level 3 - Admin (L3)</option> {/* Admin only */}
   </select>
   ```
   - Automatically sets `canApproveLeaves` and `canManageAttendance` to true when level >= 1

2. **Reporting Manager Dropdown**:
   ```javascript
   <select value={formData.reportingManager}>
     <option value="">No Reporting Manager</option>
     {managers.map(mgr => (
       <option key={mgr._id} value={mgr._id}>
         {mgr.firstName} {mgr.lastName} - L{mgr.managementLevel} ({mgr.position})
       </option>
     ))}
   </select>
   ```
   - Fetches all managers via `teamAPI.getManagers()`
   - Prevents self-reporting (filters out current employee)
   - Shows manager level and position for context

3. **Form State Updates**:
   - Added `reportingManager`, `managementLevel`, `canApproveLeaves`, `canManageAttendance` to formData
   - Fetches managers on component mount
   - Includes RM fields in edit and reset logic

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Circular Reporting**: No validation to prevent circular reporting chains (A → B → C → A). Should add graph cycle detection.

2. **Escalation to Admin**: If manager chain breaks, escalates to first admin found. Should have configurable fallback.

3. **Cron Interval**: Fixed at 6 hours. Could be made configurable via environment variable.

4. **Bulk Action Limit**: No pagination on bulk approval. Could be slow with 100+ pending leaves.

5. **Calendar View**: Only shows presence/absence, not late arrivals or early departures.

6. **Performance Metrics**: Calculated on-the-fly. Could cache for large teams (50+).
