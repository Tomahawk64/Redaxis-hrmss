# HRMS System - Final Implementation Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **L2 User Cannot See Team Members**
**Fixed**: Established reporting manager relationships in seed data
- Admin (L3) → Maria (L2) → John (L1) → [Sarah, David, Emily] (L0)
- Maria now has John as direct report
- John has Sarah, David, and Emily as direct reports

### 2. **Attendance Page Shows Empty Employee List for L2**
**Fixed**: Updated Attendance component to fetch team members via teamAPI
- L3 uses `/api/employees` (sees all)
- L2 and L1 use `/api/team/members` (sees only their team)

### 3. **No Attendance Data to Display**
**Fixed**: Created attendance seed script that populates:
- 30 days of attendance for October 2025
- All 6 users (Admin, Maria, John, Sarah, David, Emily)
- 90% attendance rate with realistic check-in/check-out times
- ~132 attendance records total

### 4. **L2 Can Only Edit Employees Under Them**
**Already Implemented**: Controller checks in place
- L2 can only update L0 and L1 employees in their hierarchy
- L2 cannot update other L2 or L3 employees

### 5. **L2/L1 Can View Their Own + Team Attendance**
**Already Implemented**: Attendance controller properly filters
- L0: Own attendance only
- L1: Own + direct reports (L0 team members)
- L2: Own + L1 managers + L0 employees under those managers
- L3: All attendance records
