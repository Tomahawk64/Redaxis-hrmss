# Attendance Fixes - Check-in Button & Employee View

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Check-in Button Still Visible After Check-in
**Problem:** When employee clicked "Check In" and got "Already checked in today" alert, the button didn't change to "Check Out"

**Root Cause:** The `handleCheckIn` function wasn't handling the error case where user was already checked in, so the UI state wasn't updated.

**Solution:**
- Modified `Dashboard.jsx` → `handleCheckIn()` function
- Added check for `response.success === false` to detect already checked-in status
- Call `checkTodayStatus()` after error to refresh the UI state
- This ensures the button changes to "Check Out" when the error occurs

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
const handleCheckIn = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await attendanceAPI.checkIn();
    
    // Check if the response indicates already checked in
    if (response.success === false) {
      alert(response.message || 'Already checked in today');
      // Refresh the status to update UI
      await checkTodayStatus();
      return;
    }
    
    alert('Checked in successfully!');
    setCheckedIn(true);
    setTodayAttendance(response.data);
    await fetchDashboardData();
  } catch (error) {
    alert(error.message || 'Check-in failed');
    // Refresh status in case of "already checked in" error
    await checkTodayStatus();
  }
};
```

### 2. Employee Can See All Attendance Records
**Problem:** Regular employees could see all employees' attendance records, not just their own

**Root Cause:** The `fetchAttendance()` and `fetchStats()` functions only filtered by employee for admin/HR when an employee was selected, but didn't automatically filter for regular employees.

**Solution:**
- Modified `Attendance.jsx` → `fetchAttendance()` function
- Modified `Attendance.jsx` → `fetchStats()` function
- Added automatic filtering for regular employees (non-admin, non-HR)
- Hid the "Employee" dropdown filter for regular employees

**Code Changes in `fetchAttendance()`:**
```javascript
const params = {
  startDate: startDate.toISOString(),
  endDate: endDate.toISOString(),
};

// If regular employee, always filter to their own records
if (!canManage) {
  params.employeeId = currentUser._id;
}
// If admin/HR and employee selected, filter by that employee
else if (canManage && selectedEmployee) {
  params.employeeId = selectedEmployee;
}
```

**Code Changes in `fetchStats()`:**
```javascript
const params = {
  startDate: startDate.toISOString(),
  endDate: endDate.toISOString(),
};

// If regular employee, always filter to their own records
if (!canManage) {
  params.employeeId = currentUser._id;
}
// If admin/HR and employee selected, add employee filter
else if (canManage && selectedEmployee) {
  params.employeeId = selectedEmployee;
}
```

**UI Changes:**
```javascript
// Hide employee dropdown for regular employees
{canManage && (
  <div className="col-md-3">
    <label className="form-label">Employee</label>
    <select 
      className="form-select"
      value={selectedEmployee}
      onChange={(e) => setSelectedEmployee(e.target.value)}
    >
      <option value="">All Employees</option>
      {employees.map(emp => (
        <option key={emp._id} value={emp._id}>
          {emp.firstName} {emp.lastName} ({emp.employeeId})
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  </div>
)}
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Dashboard.jsx**
   - Function: `handleCheckIn()`
   - Added error handling and state refresh for "already checked in" case

2. **src/components/Attendance.jsx**
   - Function: `fetchAttendance()`
   - Function: `fetchStats()`
   - UI: Employee dropdown filter
   - Added automatic filtering for regular employees

## How It Works Now

### For Regular Employees:
1. **Check-in/Check-out:**
   - Click "Check In" button
   - If already checked in, button automatically changes to "Check Out"
   - No manual refresh needed

2. **Attendance Page:**
   - Automatically shows only their own attendance records
   - Cannot see other employees' attendance
   - Employee dropdown is hidden
   - Can filter by month or specific date for their own records
   - Stats show only their attendance percentage

### For Admin/HR:
1. **Attendance Page:**
   - See all employees by default
   - Can filter by specific employee using dropdown
   - Can view any employee's attendance records
   - Stats update based on selected employee
   - Full control over attendance data

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Login as regular employee
- [x] Click "Check In" on Dashboard - should show success
- [x] Try clicking "Check In" again - should show "Already checked in" and button changes to "Check Out"
- [x] Go to Attendance page as employee
- [x] Verify only your own attendance records are shown
- [x] Verify employee dropdown is hidden
- [x] Login as Admin/HR
- [x] Go to Attendance page
- [x] Verify all employees' records are shown by default
- [x] Verify employee dropdown is visible
- [x] Select specific employee and verify filtering works

## Backend API Support

The backend already supports filtering by employee ID:
- `GET /api/attendance?employeeId=<id>` - Returns only that employee's records
- `GET /api/attendance/stats?employeeId=<id>` - Returns stats for that employee

No backend changes were required.

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Automatic State Refresh:** When "already checked in" error occurs, UI automatically updates
2. **Privacy:** Employees can only see their own data
3. **Simplified UI:** Employee dropdown hidden for those who don't need it
4. **Consistent Filtering:** All API calls (attendance, stats) use the same filtering logic
5. **Role-Based Access:** Different experience for different roles without confusing UI elements
