# Department and Position Management Feature

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive department and position management system that allows HR and Admin to create departments, define positions within each department, and assign employees to specific departments and positions during enrollment.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Department Model (`backend/models/Department.js`)
- ✅ Added `positions` field - Array of strings to store multiple positions per department
- Structure: `positions: [{ type: String, trim: true }]`

### 2. Department Controller (`backend/controllers/departmentController.js`)
- ✅ Added `deleteDepartment` function with validation:
  - Prevents deletion if department has assigned employees
  - Returns proper error messages

### 3. Department Routes (`backend/routes/departmentRoutes.js`)
- ✅ Added DELETE route: `router.delete('/:id', protect, authorize('admin', 'hr'), deleteDepartment)`
- All routes protected with authentication and authorization

## Frontend Changes

### 1. New Component: Department Management (`src/components/DepartmentManagement.jsx`)
**Features:**

## Notes

- Positions are stored as simple strings (not separate collection)
- Position dropdown is dynamically populated from selected department's positions array
- The system prevents deletion of departments with assigned employees
- All changes are automatically reflected in the UI after CRUD operations

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add employee reassignment when deleting departments
2. Implement position-based permissions/access control
3. Add department hierarchy (parent/child departments)
4. Export department structure to CSV/PDF
5. Department-wise analytics and reporting
6. Bulk position import for departments
