# Assets Management Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Assets Management system for the HRMS application that allows tracking and managing company assets allocated to employees.

## Feature Capabilities

### 1. Asset Allocation
- **Add Assets**: Admin and reporting managers can allocate assets (laptops, phones, monitors, etc.) to employees
- **Asset Details Tracked**:
  - Asset name
  - Allocation date (auto-generated)
  - Allocated by (current user)
  - Status (active/revoked)
  - Revocation details (if applicable)

### 2. Permission-Based Access
- **L0 (Employee)**: View only their own assets
- **L1 (Manager)**: View own + direct reports' assets
- **L2 (Senior Manager)**: View own + L1 managers + L0 employees under them
- **L3 (Admin)**: View all employees' assets

### 3. Asset Management Operations
- **View Assets**: Display all assets in organized employee cards
- **Allocate Asset**: Add new assets to employees via modal form
- **Revoke Asset**: Remove assets (marks as 'revoked' with timestamp and user)
- **Search & Filter**: Search by employee name, ID, or asset name
- **Status Filter**: Filter by all/active/revoked assets

---

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema (`backend/models/User.js`)
```javascript
assets: [{
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  allocatedDate: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  allocatedBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['active', 'revoked'], default: 'active' },
  revokedDate: Date,
  revokedBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
}]
```

### 2. Controller (`backend/controllers/assetsController.js`)
- **getAssets()**: Retrieve assets based on user level with population
- **addAsset()**: Add new asset to employee (permission check for admin or reporting manager)
- **revokeAsset()**: Mark asset as revoked (permission check for admin or reporting manager)

### 3. Routes (`backend/routes/assetsRoutes.js`)
```javascript
GET    /api/assets                           // Get all assets (level-filtered)
POST   /api/assets/:employeeId              // Add asset to employee
PUT    /api/assets/:employeeId/:assetId/revoke  // Revoke asset
```

### 4. Server Registration (`backend/server.js`)
```javascript
import assetsRoutes from './routes/assetsRoutes.js';
app.use('/api/assets', assetsRoutes);
```

---

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. API Service (`src/services/api.js`)
```javascript
export const assetsAPI = {
  getAll: () => apiRequest('/assets'),
  addAsset: (employeeId, assetData) => apiRequest(`/assets/${employeeId}`, {...}),
  revokeAsset: (employeeId, assetId) => apiRequest(`/assets/${employeeId}/${assetId}/revoke`, {...})
};
```

### 2. Assets Page Component (`src/components/Assets.jsx`)
**Features:**
- Display assets grouped by employee in cards
- Search functionality across employee names, IDs, and asset names
- Filter by asset status (all/active/revoked)
- Stats badge showing total assets count
- Modal form for asset allocation
- Permission-based UI rendering (only managers+ see add/revoke buttons)

**UI Elements:**
- Employee header with name, ID, position, department
- Asset count badges (active/revoked)
- Asset items with:
  - Asset name with laptop icon
  - Status badge (active/revoked)
  - Allocation date and allocated by user
  - Revocation date and revoked by user (if applicable)
  - Revoke button (for active assets, managers+ only)

### 3. Styling (`src/components/Assets.css`)
- Responsive grid layout
- Hover effects on cards and asset items
- Color-coded status (green for active, red for revoked)
- Modern gradient stats badge
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

### 4. Employee Form Integration (`src/components/Employees.jsx`)
- Added `assetsAllocated` field to form
- Input field for asset name during employee creation/edit
- Asset automatically allocated to employee after creation via assetsAPI
- Proper error handling with user feedback

### 5. Navigation (`src/App.jsx` and `src/components/SideBar.jsx`)
- Added `/assets` route in App.jsx
- Added "Assets" menu item in sidebar with laptop icon
- Accessible to all user levels

5. Submit - asset is immediately allocated and visible

### For All Users (Viewing Assets):

2. See all assets based on permission level
3. Use search to find specific employee or asset
4. Filter by status to see only active or revoked assets

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Backend Testing (Via Postman/cURL):
```bash
# Get all assets (with JWT token)
GET http://localhost:5000/api/assets

# Add asset to employee
POST http://localhost:5000/api/assets/{employeeId}
Body: { "assetName": "Laptop Dell XPS 15" }

# Revoke asset
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/assets/{employeeId}/{assetId}/revoke
```

### 2. Frontend Testing:
1. **Login as Admin (L3)**:
   - Should see all employees' assets
   - Can allocate and revoke any asset

2. **Login as Maria (L2)**:
   - Should see own + John's + Sarah/David/Emily's assets
   - Can allocate/revoke assets for team members

3. **Login as John (L1)**:
   - Should see own + Sarah/David/Emily's assets
   - Can allocate/revoke assets for direct reports

4. **Login as Sarah/David/Emily (L0)**:
   - Should see only own assets
   - Cannot allocate or revoke assets (no buttons visible)

## Permission Matrix

| User Level | Can View Assets | Can Allocate | Can Revoke | Scope |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| L3 (Admin) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All employees |
| L2 (Sr. Manager) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Own + L1 + L0 under them |
| L1 (Manager) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Own + direct reports |
| L0 (Employee) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Only self |

---

## Security Features

1. **Backend Permission Checks**: 
   - getAssets() filters data by user level
   - addAsset() validates user is admin or reporting manager
   - revokeAsset() validates user is admin or reporting manager

2. **Frontend Permission Checks**:
   - Add/Revoke buttons only shown to users with `managementLevel >= 1`
   - Employee dropdown only shown to managers and admins

3. **JWT Authentication**:
   - All routes protected with `protect` middleware
   - Token includes managementLevel for authorization

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Asset Categories**: Group assets by type (IT, Furniture, Vehicle)
2. **Asset Value**: Track monetary value of assets
3. **Asset History**: Show complete history of asset transfers
4. **Bulk Operations**: Allocate/revoke multiple assets at once
5. **Asset Requests**: Allow L0 employees to request assets
6. **Asset Maintenance**: Track service/repair history
7. **Asset Images**: Upload photos of assets
8. **QR Code**: Generate QR codes for asset tracking
9. **Export**: Export asset reports to PDF/Excel
10. **Notifications**: Email notifications on allocation/revocation

---

## Known Limitations

1. Asset name is free text (no predefined asset catalog)
2. No asset serial number tracking
3. One-time allocation in employee form (edit mode doesn't add new assets)
4. No bulk asset import/export
5. Asset revocation is permanent (cannot be reactivated)
