# CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Attendance Display Issue

## What the Logs Show

### Backend (Working ✅)
```
Attendance Found: 1 records
First record: {
  employee: { firstName: 'Sarah', lastName: 'Johnson' },
  date: 2025-10-22T18:30:00.000Z,
  checkIn: 2025-10-23T10:20:14.910Z,
  status: 'present'
}
```

Backend IS finding and returning the records!

### Frontend (Broken ❌)
```
Attendance records: ▶ Array(0)  ← Empty!
```

Frontend is receiving an empty array even though backend returned data!

## The Problem

There's a **disconnect between what the backend sends and what the frontend receives**.

Possible causes:
1. API response format mismatch
2. Frontend parsing error
3. Response interception/transformation issue
4. CORS issue stripping data

## Need to Check

1. **Network Tab**: See actual HTTP response
2. **API Service**: Check if response is being transformed
3. **Response Structure**: Verify `response.data` exists

## Next Steps

1. Add logging in `api.js` to see raw response
2. Check Network tab for actual API response
3. Verify no middleware is modifying response

**The backend is working perfectly. The issue is in the frontend API layer or response handling!**
